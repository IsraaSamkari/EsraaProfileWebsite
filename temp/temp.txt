Human pose estimation is a task that involves locating the body joints in the image. Current deep learning models accurately estimate the locations of the joints. However, they struggle with smaller joints like the wrist and ankle, leading to lower accuracy. Existing solutions are to build a deeper model or capture the long-range spatial dependency. However, each of these solutions adds complexity to the model. Therefore, we present an efficient network that can capture more features of the joints by increasing the network channels. Our network structure follows multiple stages and multiple branches while maintaining high-resolution output along the network. Hence, we called this network Wide High-Resolution Network (WideHRNet). WideHRNet provides several advantages. First, it provides a high-resolution output and runs in parallel. Second, it obtains superior results by using a few layers. Third, the expanding channels can be controlled via a hyperparameter, which provides the ability to reduce the model complexity. Fourth, it further boosts performance by adding channel attention. Experimental results on the MPII dataset show that the WideHRNet outperforms state-of-the-art efficient models, achieving 88.47\% with the attention block.
